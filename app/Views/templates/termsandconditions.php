    <p class="whatisstep"><b>The Standardized Test of English Proficiency (STEP)</b> is an English language certification exam for Indian students and job-seekers. This test will help students, institutions and employers assess and improve their reading, writing, listening and speaking skills. This is an important new venture by The Hindu Group and is a core part of our brand and social mission. We hope to leave a lasting impact on all the lives that we touch with this effort and make a major contribution towards improving employability and the skills of Indian youth. This version of the test is a beta or pilot and is being used to validate the underlying methodology and technology. The results presented here are preliminary and not fully calibrated. For more information, including technical support, contact us at info@steptest.in or 1800 3000 6063</p>
